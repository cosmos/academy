# Application Development

## SDK

See the [Cosmos SDK Read The Docs](http://cosmos-sdk.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

## ABCI

The [ABCI repo](https://github.com/tendermint/abci) has some excellent
resources to help you get started. To get acquainted with ABCI and
building apps in any language (for which an ABCI server exists) or
writing your own server, the following is a logical sequence of
information to read through:

-   The [README](https://github.com/tendermint/abci/blob/master/README.md)
    is a great starting point and orients you around the repo and
    some examples.
-   There's an [Introduction to ABCI](http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/introduction.html#abci-overview)
    in Tendermint's Read the Docs, which provides context for the ABCI
-   The [Tendermint 102 Read The Docs](http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/#tendermint-102) is
    mostly dedicated to the ABCI and ABCI app development
-   The above includes a specification, which can also be found
    [here](https://github.com/tendermint/abci/blob/master/specification.rst).
-   there is a section about the ABCI in the [Cosmos Whitepaper](https://cosmos.network/whitepaper#abci-specification),
    providing additional context.

## LotionJS
