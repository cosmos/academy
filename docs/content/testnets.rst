Testnets
========

There are two approaches to learning about testnets: create your own for an application or join an existing one. The former is good practice for the latter and that is the order we recommend going about this. There are also two kinds of testnets: Tendermint testnets and Gaia testnets. A great starting point for most users is Gaia; Tendermint testnets are primarily used for research.

Create
------

For both manual and automated deployment of Tendermint testnets, see the `deploy testnets section in Tendermint's Read The Docs <http://tendermint.readthedocs.io/en/master/deploy-testnets.html>`__.

Deploying your own Gaia testnet works essentially the same way (the commands are the same - gaia imports Tendermint Core)

Join
----

For those who want to either run a full node or become a validator by joining the latest Cosmos testnet, see the `Cosmos testnet repo README <https://github.com/cosmos/testnets/blob/master/README.md>`__.

End-users who want to run the UI should download the `latest Voyager binary <https://github.com/cosmos/voyager/releases>`__.

There are no long-running Tendermint testnets currently maintained, but you can see the `Tendermint testnet repo <https://github.com/tendermint/testnets>`__ for archives of previous testnets.
