very crushâ€‹hi everybodyï»¿

Ethan Buchmanâ€‹ðŸ˜‰ï»¿

Dave Brysonâ€‹Nice featureï»¿ - What's the ramifications of only creating blocks with transactions? Can it weaken the chain?

very crushâ€‹can't weaken the chain because it sï»¿ still in the chain but it can maybe slow it

Robert Davidâ€‹should intentional forksï»¿ even be prevented?

Robert Davidâ€‹or canï»¿ they be totally prevented?

Robert Davidâ€‹agreed...ï»¿

TheMakownageâ€‹Does it mean Ethereum isï»¿ much more susceptible to 33% attack ?

TheMakownageâ€‹(sinceï»¿ block time is way shorter)

very crushâ€‹theorically onlyï»¿

ANIL KUMAR ANANDâ€‹Dont know if its asked before.. any thoughts on plasma.io plasma sounds like all the performanceï»¿ gain we were expecting from cosmos can be achieved with plasma.. your thoughts?

Dave Brysonâ€‹Is their a specific branch for this refactor under basecoin - to browseï»¿ the code?

TheMakownageâ€‹(unrelated to this chat, but the general channel in rocket chat seems toï»¿ be buggy)
